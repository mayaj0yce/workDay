This is a great organizer for your work day!! It stores the hours from 9-5.

Every hour can be customized with your own text.
The save button commits the data into the local storage.

The hours that have passed are in grey, the current hour is in red, the hours to come are displayed in green. This makes it easy to see what is to come and what has already been completed.
